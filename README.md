### Predicting Spotify preferences: 

This was a final project for the Practical Data Science course at Carnegie Mellon. I collaborated with Zuhayer Quazi and Zach Goldstein. You can view it here:

There are a few errors because our .csv cannot be packaged with the notebook, but we saved the output from our data so you can still view the main results of our work.

The first task was to predict music preferences based on quantitative factors like tempo, length, instruments vs vocals, and some categorical variables like key. We used our results from this to recommend new music from the week's top hits that we predicted the user would like. 

You can try this notebook yourself by downloading it, inputting your spotify username, and letting it analyze your playlists.
